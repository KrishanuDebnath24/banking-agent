"""The eval dataset, as code: each case's expected answer comes from the fixture's oracle,
so the dataset can't drift from the data. Synced to LangSmith by evals/run.py.

Fields (all optional except id, category, turns):
    turns            the customer's messages; only the last one is scored
    amounts          figures that must appear in the final answer (e.g. "160.36")
    subagents        subagents that must be used;  tools: tools that must be called
    forbidden_tools  tools that must not be called
    action           the write action that should be proposed, e.g. {"name": ..., "args": {...}}
                     (the harness declines it, so the bank never changes during a run)
    decision         "approve" to let a proposed action run (only for actions the bank refuses)
    no_action        no write action may be proposed at all (default for read-only categories)
    must_not_contain strings that must never appear in the answer (another customer's data, etc.)
    must_contain     strings that must appear in the answer (e.g. "SR-" for a request reference)
    guard            a deterministic guardrail that must fire, e.g. "card_number"
    refuse           the answer should politely decline (checked by the judge, or a keyword fallback)
    rubric           extra instructions for the judge
