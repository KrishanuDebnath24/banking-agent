"""Service MCP server: customer profile, address changes and service requests.

Address changes take effect straight away: once the customer has confirmed the
change and entered the security code emailed to them, the new address is saved
at the bank as a personal attribute on their own login (OBP keeps the customer
record itself for staff only), and get_my_profile reads it back from there.

Cheque books and identity (KYC) updates need bank staff, so they are logged as
service requests (with a reference number) for the back office, like a real
bank's case system. The bank is also sent a customer message for each one.

Requests are kept in the service_requests table (Postgres if DATABASE_URL is set, else a SQLite
file). Requests logged before that, in service_requests.jsonl, are copied in once on first use.
